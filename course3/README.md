Leap year - working good
Fibonacci - I don't see a way to use recursion over there - plain/old school while

Couple questions to the course (marked with @TODO):
didn't succeed to use prototype and set a reference to the click event on the button
    parseString.strRverse = throw error (`this` is not known), same with parseString.palindrom

didn't succeed to use reverseString function inside is palindrom function (they both prototypes of parseString)
